# Evaluation of Super-Resolution Technology in Cancer Pathology Image Analysis

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this pre-pilot version of our study to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution technology in cancer pathology image analysis. This research aims to assess whether super-resolution imaging techniques improve the ability to detect and analyze cancer cells compared to traditional imaging methods.

### Instructions

You will be presented with four pairs of cancer images side by side. In some images, the original images will be on the left and super-resolution images on the right and vice versa. Below are two demonstrations of these setups:
<!-- - Left: Original image
- Right: Super-resolution version of the same image -->

The original and the super-resolution images are **synchronized**, meaning any interaction you perform (such as zooming or panning) will affect both images simultaneously. Before proceeding with the evaluation, we encourage you to:

- **Zoom-in and Zoom-out adequetely using mouse or keypad to spot their resolutional differences**
- **Pan across different areas by selecting one of the images**
- **Take time to explore the details thoroughly**

For each image pair, you will be asked to evaluate various aspects of image quality and cancerous region detection utility by scoring six metrices and one open-ended questions. The score is set for each metric on continous a scale of 0 to 100, where:
- 0 = Left is better
- 50 = Same
- 100 = Right is better

Please take sufficient time to examine each image pair thoroughly before submitting your assessment. After completing all four image pairs, you will be asked to complete a brief post-study questionnaire. As part of the pre-pilot, there will be a feedback form at the very end of the study session.

Your careful consideration and detailed feedback are invaluable to our research. Please click "Next" to provide your consent and begin the study.
