## Purpose of the Study

This study is being conducted by researchers at the University of Utahâ€™s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The purpose of this research study is to understand if the super-resolution images are useful in identifying cancer in pathology images, what improvements are needed and how good the super-resolution images in comparison to original pathological images.

## Procedures

You will be presented with a four pair of pathological images with potential cancerous regions. For each image,  you may need to zoom in, zoom out, pan, annotate, and perform other necessary interactions with the tools to analyze the images. Then, you will be asked to choose one of the images based on some metrices. This study session should take approximately 10-15 minute to complete.

## Risks and Benefits

We may contact you in the future for further research purposes regarding cancer identification in pathological images, so there is a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality of contact information. Other than that, you may experience a benefit in the form of increased insight into your research practices and support needs. 

There are no direct benefits to taking part in this study. However, we hope the information we get from this study can be used to define, develop, and tailor tools used in digital pathology to identify cancerous regions from pathology images. It also helps the scientific visualization community to understand how user studies can benefit in making decisions. 

## Confidentiality

All responses that are collected during the course of the study will be kept in a locked cabinet or on a password-protected computer in the laboratory/offices of the Principal Investigators and the Sub-investigators. Only the PIs and their research team will have access to this information. Portions of the data collected in this experiment may be presented at a conference or published in a scientific journal. If this is the case, identifiers will be removed from the data in these presentations or publications. 

## Voluntary Participation

You may choose not to participate in this study. You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any point and for any reason without affecting your relationship with the Principal Investigators (PIs) or their research team.
