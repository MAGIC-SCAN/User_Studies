# Evaluation of Super-Resolution Technology in Cancer Pathology Image Analysis

### Instructions

You will be presented with twenty pairs of cancer images side by side. In some images, the original images will be on the left and super-resolution images on the right and vice versa. Below are two demonstrations of these setups:

![Demo comparison image2](./assets/demo/demo2.jpeg)

The original and the super-resolution images are **synchronized**, meaning any interaction you perform (such as zooming or panning) will affect both images simultaneously. Before proceeding with the evaluation, we encourage you to:

- **Zoom-in and Zoom-out adequetely using mouse or keypad to spot their resolutional differences**
- **Pan across different areas by selecting one of the images**
- **Take time to explore the details thoroughly**

For each image pair, you will be asked to evaluate various aspects of image quality and cancerous region detection utility by scoring six metrices and one open-ended questions. The score is set for each metric on continous a scale of 0 to 100, where:
- 0 = Left is better
- 50 = Same
- 1 = Right is better

Please take sufficient time to examine each image pair thoroughly before submitting your assessment. After completing all ten image pairs, you will be asked to complete a brief post-study questionnaire.

Your careful consideration and detailed feedback are invaluable to our research. Please click "Next" to provide your consent and begin the study.
