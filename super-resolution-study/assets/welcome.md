# Evaluation of Super-Resolution Technology in Cancer Pathology Image Analysis

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this study of evaluating the effectiveness of super-resolution technology in cancer pathology image analysis. This research aims to assess whether super-resolution imaging techniques improve the ability to detect and analyze cancer cells compared to traditional imaging methods.

### Instructions

You will be presented with ten pairs of cancer images side by side. In some images, the original images will be on the left and super-resolution images on the right and vice-versa. Below are two demonstration of these setup:
<!-- - Left: Original image
- Right: Super-resolution version of the same image -->

The original and the super-resolution images are synchronized, meaning any interaction you perform (such as zooming or panning) will affect both images simultaneously. Before proceeding with the evaluation, we encourage you to:
- Utilize the zoom-in and zoom-out features
- Pan across different areas of the images
- Take time to explore the details thoroughly

For each image pair, you will be asked to evaluate various aspects of image quality and diagnostic utility by scoring five metrices and one open-ended questions. The score is set for each metric on a scale of -1, 0, 1, where:
- -1 = Left is better
- 0 = Same
- 1 = Right is better

Please take sufficient time to examine each image pair thoroughly before submitting your assessment. After completing all ten image pairs, you will be asked to complete a brief post-study questionnaire.

Your careful consideration and detailed feedback are invaluable to our research. Please click "Next" to provide your consent and begin the study.
